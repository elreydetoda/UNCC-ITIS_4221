# Secure Programming and Penetration Testing

This is an attempt to modernize the pentesting class that we take at UNCC. I will be using more modern tools such as docker and vagrant to be able to ensure that the lab environment that we setup and utilize is uniformed. These tools were created for such purpose, why not use them in the classroom?

## Requirements
* docker
* vagrant
