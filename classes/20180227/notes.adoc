= XSS, Clickjacking, and Secure Code Practices
* XSS
** attach url - http://localhost:1337/xssEncode.php?name=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27vuln%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
* set url under instead of javascript
* put url wherever needed.
* clickjacking
** cj.html iframe at the bottom of the page
** load frame with all parameters with it and then place over the ui
// browser xss protection 1 = on
* `header('X-XSS-Protection: 0');`
Content security = stop inline javascript
* self is for specifying only same web domain
* unsafe-inline (for legacy code that needs inline javascript, but stops from external reference js code injection)

Clickjacking

tls - tls v1 is old ssl now is the new understanding
ssl-strip prevention
* HSTS

* Attacking hashes
** hash algorithm
** rainbow tables
** bruteforce
** salt + password hash a thousand times
